  <h1>The Awaken Dreams Mod</h1>
  <p>The Awaken Dreams mod is a major part of The Valar Project and it aims to enhance Minecraft to provide a better experience on our server, and in the future will also work to create a unique adventure experience on single-player mode as well. It currently adds hundreds of custom blocks and items to help make the whole experience more authentic.</p>
  <p>The mod was programmed entriely by the current project leader, scribblemaniac. Because of this, development has been very slow. The mod has now been made open source, and is available for anyone to contribute to on <a href="https://github.com/TheValarProject/AwakenDreamsClient">Github</a>. Hopefully our openness will enourage new developers and result in more frequent releases. Even if this does not happen, we will still make progress slowly and steadly so please be patient.</p>
  <p>We have a lot in store for the mod, so please check out our <a href="/modPlans.php">plans</a> for more details.</p>
