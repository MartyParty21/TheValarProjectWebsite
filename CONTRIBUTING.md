# Contributing

There are a LOT of ways to contribute to this project.

TODO Complete contributing guidelines. For now just ask scribblemaniac if you want to help with something.

## Client
The client mod is for Minecraft and is built with MCP.

## Server
The server mod is a custom version of Cuberite. At the moment, no work has been completed on this as the previous version of the server mod was for Bukkit.

## Website
The website uses a PHP backend and a combination of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and jQuery for the client side. We also use the jsSHA library for challenge-response login authentication. We are open to suggestionsfor new libraries, however there should be some need fulfilled by them that cannot be achieved with the exiting tools.

## Installer / Launcher
The existing launcher is written in C# (I think?) by our project member jonypony. Whether or not that is made open source under our license is entierly up to him. Disscussions on this matter are currently taking place. Either way, we will likely rewrite the program in QT or make an installer in QT.
