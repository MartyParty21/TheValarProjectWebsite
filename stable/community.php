  <h1>Community</h1>
  <p>Currently you can join our community by actively participating on the server. Our primary form of instant communication is on our <a href="https://discord.gg/hvJrwYX">Discord server</a>. We have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDR5oPhtfihRyX9oEi3on2g">Youtube channel</a> where we post updates, features, tutorials, and more so subscribe to that so you don't miss out. We also have a <a href="https://plus.google.com/108717602686570585467?pageId=115475084700439800717">Googe+ account</a> and a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Valar-Project-MC/514615731895565">Facebook page</a>, but these aren't very active right now.</p>
  <p>We are planning to do additional things to promote a community among our users, including forums, a messenging system, and a wiki. However we have not finished these projects yet, so please be patient while we work on them.</p>
