  <p>A primary component of The Valar Project is its Minecraft server. It is a custom modded server that uses requires the Awaken Dreams to join. This mod opens the opportunity for many new building blocks, npcs, and experiences. The server also uses one of the largest maps of Middle Earth to allow use to recreate the world in intricate details.</p>
  <p>For many people, the best part of our server is not the mod or the map, but instead the great community. Our members our friendly and welcoming, and our staff does its best to promote a peaceful and collaborative environment for building and roleplaying.</p>
  <p>To explore all of the different places on our server, you can of course join and explore that way, but you can also use our website to view a <a href="map.php">map</a> and <a href="places.php">places of interests</a>. You can also review our <a href="rules.php">rules</a> and <a href="ranks.php">ranks</a></p>
