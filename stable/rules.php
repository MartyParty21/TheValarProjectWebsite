  <p>Here are the rules for the server, and must be followed at all times:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Do not grief, or build onto anything without permission from an admin or a builder.</li>
    <li>Respect all players and staff, regardless of rank.</li>
    <li>We are not a survival server, do not treat the landscape as such.</li>
    <li>No asking for promotions, special items, perks, or any other sort of personal gain in the main chat (gamemode and teleports are the exception).</li>
    <li>Nothing can be hidden from admins; always be honest to them.</li>
    <li>If you have a suggestion for the server or the mod, please post it onto the server page on Planet Minecraft.</li>
    <li>Do not build offensive or sexual buildings in freebuild, typically only builds related to the Middle Earth Theme are allowed.</li>
    <li>Do not advertise for this server on any other server, and vice versa.</li>
    <li>Do not steal from other players.</li>
    <li>Do not cheat in roleplay or events.</li>
    <li>New players are asked to wait until they are given building assignments; never build alone unless in freebuild.</li>
    <li>No coloured nicknames. Don't ask for nicknames of cannon characters (Gandalf, Aragorn, Frodo, etc.).</li>
    <li>No spamming.</li>
    <li>Have fun!</li>
  </ol>
